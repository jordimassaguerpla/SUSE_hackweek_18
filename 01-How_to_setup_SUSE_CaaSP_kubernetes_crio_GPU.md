# How to setup SUSE CaaSP 4.0 Beta3 to work with GPU

SUSE CaaSP 4.0 is build on top of Kubernetes and cri-o. What we need to do is start by installing SUSE CaaSP and then setup the nvidia parts that glue kubernetes, cri-o and NVIDIA drivers, and then setup a NVIDIA kubernetes device plugin, so pods can "expose" gpus as resources.

## Installing SUSE CaaSP

We need a cluster, that is obvious :), so let's start with installing two nodes with [SUSE CaaSP 4.0 Beta3](https://www.suse.com/betaprogram/caasp-beta/) powered by [SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP1](https://www.suse.com/products/server/), which will become our worker and master nodes:

* __gpu__: A bare metal workstation with [NVIDIA Quadro K2000 graphics card](https://www.nvidia.com/content/PDF/data-sheet/DS_NV_Quadro_K2000_OCT13_NV_US_LR.pdf)

* __master__:A virtual machine

You can do that by following the [SUSE CaaSP Beta 3 deployment instructions](https://susedoc.github.io/doc-caasp/beta/caasp-deployment/single-html/#_deployment_on_existing_sles_installation).


> __Tip__   
_Make sure you have a user "sles" which can run "sudo" without a password, and that both nodes have the other's public ssh keys in "~sles/.ssh/authorized_keys". Also, as stated in the deployment guide, that you have the ssh-agent running, and add the hostnames into /etc/hosts so they are both reachable by hostname_. Then, disable _firewalld_ and enable _sshd_.
  
> __Tip__
_Do not configure a swap partition and set the vm to use 2 CPUs. Otherwise, SUSE CaaSP will fail to install._
>
  
Finally, we need both machines to be in the same network. For this, I setup the vm to use a _macvtap host device_. You can find more info on _macvtap_ [here](https://virt.kernelnewbies.org/MacVTap). However, I just did that with _virt-manager_ on [openSUSE Leap 15.1](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:15.1)*.

_(*): This is not precise. Actually, for whatever reason, I could not setup this with the virt-manager run as a "normal user" but I could if I started virt-manager from YaST (with root permissions... may that be the reason?)_

>__Tip__
_Do you want to know if the cluster is properly setup? Run the [k8s conformance tests](https://github.com/cncf/k8s-conformance/blob/master/instructions.md)._
>

Once we have a SUSE CaaSP cluster running, we can proceed to install the NVIDIA drivers.

## Installing nvidia graphics driver kernel module

So we have a workstation with NVIDIA GPU [compatible with](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus) [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) (in our case Quadro K2000). Now is time to install the right drivers so we can use that.

Drivers can be installed from [NVIDIA download servers](https://download.nvidia.com/suse/sle15sp1/x86_64/):
  
    sudo zypper ar https://download.nvidia.com/suse/sle15sp1/ nvidia
    sudo zypper ref
    sudo zypper install nvidia-gfxG05-kmp-default

You can check if drivers are loaded:
  
    lsmod | grep nvidia
  
Now that we have the drivers, we can install the NVIDIA driver for computing with GPUs using CUDA.
  
## Installing NVIDIA driver for computing with GPUs using CUDA
  
After installing nvidia drivers, we need to install the nvidia-computeG05. Given we setup the nvidia repo from the previous step, all we need to do is:
  
    sudo zypper install nvidia-computeG05

Then, add your user to the video group, and also to the root user:

    sudo usermod -G video -a sles
    sudo usermod -G video -a root

> __Important__: If you are not a member of the video group, you won't be able to access the nvidia devs at /dev/nvidia* . Later you will see that even running as root is not enough, that you need to **explicetely** run as **root:video**.

You can check if this is running by running
  
    nvidia-smi

and you should get this output

 Congrats! We have drivers installed! Let's continue with installing the nvidia container libs :)

## Installing libnvidia-container

Ready for starting with the container specific parts? Let's start with libnvidia-container

What is [libnvidia-container](https://github.com/NVIDIA/libnvidia-container) ? See definition in the github project:
> This repository provides a library and a simple CLI utility to automatically configure GNU/Linux containers leveraging NVIDIA hardware.  
The implementation relies on kernel primitives and is designed to be agnostic of the container runtime.
>
Unfortunately, NVIDIA is not building packages for SUSE, so we will use the "distribution agnostic build", downloadable from the release page:

https://github.com/NVIDIA/libnvidia-container/releases/download/v1.0.0/libnvidia-container_1.0.0_x86_64.tar.xz

> __Info__
> The latest release is 1.0.2, but that one was built with a more recent glibc and so we cannot install it on SLE15SP1
> 

You can untar that package and copy the binaries in bin and libs to /usr/bin and /usr/lib64.

    tar xJf libnvidia-container_1.0.0_x86_64.tar.xz
    cp libnvidia-container_1.0.0/usr/local/bin/nvidia-container-cli /usr/bin
    cp libnvidia-container_1.0.0/usr/local/lib/libnvidia-container.so* /usr/lib64

> __Info__
> I guess you could also copy to /usr/local and set the PATH and the ldconfig paths

To test it, run

    nvidia-container-cli info

and you should get

    NVRM version:   430.26                                                          
    CUDA version:   10.2

And we have the libnvidia container installed! Now let's go for the hook, that will plug cri-o with the libnvidia-container.

## Installing nvidia-container-runtime-hook

Since we are using cri-o, all we need to do is to setup a [OCI hook](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o#oci-hooks-support) that will run some custom binary _pre-starting_ a container. This binary will setup GPU access for the container by leveraging nvidia-container-cli which we already installed.

This is the [nvidia-container-runtime-hook](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-container-runtime/tree/master/hook).

> _Info_
> Note we don't need to install any modified runc or cri-o. This is the difference with docker. If we were using docker, we would need to install a modified runtime (runc) or modified docker (nvidia-docker). With cri-o, we can use upstream cri-o and we don't have to maintain a forked runc.

Unfortunately, NVIDIA is not building this for SUSE and, alike the libnvidia-container, is neither building it distribution agnostic. I could have build it for SUSE, but this would have taken me the whole hackweek (at least), so instead I took the CentOS RPM, unpack it and copied the binaries over:

    docker run -ti -v$PWD:/var:/tmp centos:7
    DIST=$(. /etc/os-release; echo $ID$VERSION_ID)
    curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-container-runtime/$DIST/nvidia-container-runtime.repo |    tee /etc/yum.repos.d/nvidia-container-runtime.repo
    yum install --downloadonly nvidia-container-runtime-hook
    cp /var/cache/yum/x86_64/7/nvidia-container-runtime/packages/nvidia-container-runtime-hook-1.4.0-2.x86_64.rpm /var/tmp
    exit
    unrpm nvidia-container-runtime-hook-1.4.0-2.x86_64.rpm

now you can copy the contents of the rpm

* /etc/nvidia-container-runtime/config.toml 
* /usr/bin/nvidia-container-runtime-hook
* /usr/share/containers/oci/hooks.d/oci-nvidia-hook.json

And **very important** , edit the  /etc/nvidia-container-runtime/config.toml  and set

    user = "root:video"

> __Tip__
> Do you want to test if this is working?
> Install podman, comment the cni_default_network in /etc/containers/libpod.conf, and run
>  _sudo podman  run nvidia/cuda nvidia-smi_
>  and you should get the nvidia-smi output as you were running it on the host

Now, cri-o is able to run a container with GPU acceleration. Next step is kubernetes "setup".


## NVIDIA Device Plugin

The NVIDIA device plugin for Kubernetes is a _Daemonset_ that allows you to automatically:

-   Expose the number of GPUs on each nodes of your cluster
-   Keep track of the health of your GPUs
-   Run GPU enabled containers in your Kubernetes cluster.

This [repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin) contains NVIDIA's official implementation of the [Kubernetes device plugin](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/resource-management/device-plugin.md).

Thus, let's "install" it:

    kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin/1.0.0-beta/nvidia-device-plugin.yml

And that is all!

See that the node is exposing the NVIDIA GPUs by running

    kubectl describe pod gpu

And you should get something like:
    
    Allocatable:                                                                    
    ...
    nvidia.com/gpu:     1                                                          
    Allocated resources:                                                            
      (Total limits may be over 100 percent, i.e., overcommitted.)                  
      Resource           Requests  Limits
      --------           --------  ------

      ephemeral-storage  0 (0%)    0 (0%)                                           
      nvidia.com/gpu     0         0                                                
      Events:              <none>   

See the **nvidia.com/gpu** ? :)

## Testing

We have all setup and running now, let's have some more fun and do some testing :)

Let's create a file named *cuda-vector-add.yaml*:  
                                                                                
    apiVersion: v1                                                                  
    kind: Pod                                                                       
    metadata:                                                                       
      name: cuda-vector-add

      restartPolicy: OnFailure

        - name: cuda-vector-add

              nvidia.com/gpu: 1 # requesting 1 GPU 

"Run it":
    
    kubectl create -f cuda-vector-add.yaml                                          

and see the output

    kubectl logs cuda-vector-add

    Done                                                                            
                                                                                
if we change the requested gput to 2
    
    nvidia.com/gpu: 2 # requesting **2** GPU                              

Then you will see how this does not get scheduled, because our workstation has only 1 GPU:
  
    kubectl get pods

# TODOs

So we manage! We have SUSE CaaSP Cluster scheduling pods that need GPUs to a node that has an NVIDIA GPU. What is left? I am sure you can guess it .... **PACKAGING**

* Packaging libnvidia-containers
* Packaging nvidia-containers-runtime-hook

> __Warning__
